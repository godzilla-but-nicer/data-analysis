## Make hypotheses

The first step is figuring out what it is we're trying to learn. The most
principled thing to do is come up with a hypothesis. This does two things, it
forces us to think deeply about what precisely we hope to learn and it grounds
our questions in a theoretical understanding.

A hypothesis is a prediction. Something like, "when a prison goes private
it becomes more dangerous to inmates" or "ICE detentions are more common in 
poor cities than rich ones." Often we will start with something broad like 
these and iteratively narrow our prediction until we get to precise testable 
hypotheses tractable to our statistical methods.

Sometimes, we will start exploring dataset without a hypothesis first. Maybe we
stumble on a cool dataset or hear of a new leak that we're sure will be 
interesting. That's ok, sometimes [a hypothesis can be a liability](https://cdn.serc.carleton.edu/files/tides/teaching-materials/physicalscience/u2.5_hypothesis_liability.pdf). Personally, I find the prediction testing approach
to be useful much of the time but that won't always be the case. Ultimately,
what matters is that we have a sense of what we're looking for and a way to
continually evaluate whether we're making progress on finding it.

## Find data

Once we have an idea of what we want to learn, we can start looking for data.
There are many ways to go about this depending on what we're looking for. Here
is a few places that are good to look but we'll have some time to spend
looking together.

## Exploratory data analysis

This is my favorite part. Here is where we try to figure out what is going on
in our data. Much of the hands on work is exploratory data analysis. We will
sift through documents, convert data to more usable formats, produce cool
data visualizations, look for relationships between variables and so on.

Much of we talk about in this course can be broadly called "exploratory
data analysis" so we won't get into it much here.

## Repeat

Once we start looking at our data our understanding of what we're doing
will almost certainly change. Ideally, all that happens is that we are able to 
make a new, more precise, more testable prediction. Maybe our hypothesis about
the improved danger in private prisons becomes more specific with an
operationalized definition of dangerous like "more deaths." Maybe instead, we
realized that in order to test our prediction about ICE detentions and wealth
we need to get income data from the IRS or we want to control for population
size and need to look for census data.

Maybe we just got lucky and figured out some new questions we want to ask. This
will probably happen! In any case, after looking at the data we'll probably
reevaluate our predictions and sources of data and thats normal. Remember, ultimately we're trying to construct an argument, maybe its to convince
ourselves and maybe its to convince others. Regardless, so long as our logic is
sound, and we're not cheating, we're ok.

## Test Hypotheses

A "hypothesis test" means something very specific in statistics and we'll get
into that later. Really, what we mean here is "figure out if your prediction
was right or not" or "answer the question you were hoping to answer." This \
could mean a formal hypothesis test but it also could mean a compelling chart
or an argument drawn from a close reading of documents.

## Publish and/or Refine

Based on how testing your hypothesis went, it might be time to write up and 
share your argument. Testing your hypothesis will have told you whether or not
your prediction was right, this in itself might be enough to share. You can
use the results of hypothesis testing as well as intermediate findings from
exploratory data analysis to construct an argument, typically, but not always,
in the form of a written report.

Whether we are at a point where we want to construct an argument or not, we 
may want to keep working on thing. This is once again a point where we might
want to go back to making more predictions, asking more questions, and/or find
more data.
